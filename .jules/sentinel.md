## 2026-02-14 - [Path Traversal in API Endpoint]
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/read_file` endpoint blindly concatenated user-provided filename to `public/` directory path, allowing traversal via `..`.
**Learning:** Even with URL routing/normalization, raw file system access using user input MUST always be validated. FastAPI/Starlette routers do not guarantee traversal protection for file paths constructed manually.
**Prevention:** Validate resolved paths using `os.path.abspath` and check if they start with the intended base directory.
